After experiencing high volatility with "the latest and greatest", I began look for free open-source software solutions that have withstood the test of time and that would run on the most generic of hardware.  

The solution that has served me well:  programming in Common Lisp, the second oldest extant programming language, installed on the oldest distribution of the gnu linux operating system:  Slackware Linux.  

README-COMMON-LISP describes more reasons behind my choice of Common Lisp as my primary language for software development.  
README-SLACKWARE describe more reasons for choosing slackware.  
README.SBOMG contains the instructions for building 3rd party softare from slackbuilds.org using sbomg.lisp.
