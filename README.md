My first common lisp applicaton to share is called sbomg.lisp (sbo manager).  Whenever I upgrade slackware, I like to also upgrade all the third party packages available from https://www.slackbuilds.org.  sbomg.lisp does this and is a huge timesaver.  

The following prerequisites have to be met for sbomg.lisp to work

Default Slackware ships with clisp, so I'm just using that.

However, clisp has to be configured for quicklisp, common lisp's package manager for popular common lisp systems.  To do so, download https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp , then at cli (on a slackware system of course), type clisp, and at the lisp prompt enter (load "quicklisp.lisp") and it will prompt you for how you want to configure quicklisp--I just choose all the defaults, which creates a folder in my home folder called quicklisp, and which loads the quicklisp system by default when I start clisp.  

Sbopkg from https://sbopkg.org is also a needed prerequisite.  And, because sbomg.lisp runs "slackpkg clean-system" between builds of the various 3rd-party packages from slackbuilds, sbopkg must be added to /etc/slackpkg/blacklist so clean-system doesn't remove it while sbomg.lisp is running.

Once quicklisp is configured, and once sbopkg is installed and added to the slackpkg blacklist, at the cli in the directory where you saved sbomg.lisp excute clisp, and then at the lisp prompt enter (load "sbomg.lisp"), and watch it build your third party packages!  Oh, you probably will want to edit sbomg.lisp and add the third party packages you want to build:  sbomg.lisp is divided into two sections, packages without dependencies, and packages with dependencies.  Manually add packages that don't have dependencies to the first list, and packages that do to the second.

Please fork and make improvements, as this is my first common-lisp project beyond hello-world, and I'm sure it could be improved.
