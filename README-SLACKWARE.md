I'm a slacker -- that is, a user of Slackware Linux, a distribution that has stood the test of time. It has been said, that when one learns slackware one learns linux. It is also said that slackware is for advanced users; however, IMHO, due to its clear documentation that actually works when one follows it to the tee, Slackware is just as much for users who want to advance in their understanding of gnu linux.
